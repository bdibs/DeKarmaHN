# DeKarmaHN

DeKarmaHN is a Chrome extension that lets you hide [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) karma points and other "
nudges" that could subconsciously change your opinion.

This extension currently:

* Hides your total karma count in the header
* Hides karma on profile pages
* Hides comment points
* Changes faded comments to appear like the rest

I decided to make this because of [this thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26205576) and it sounded like a fun
first web extension, but it ended up being quite underwhelming.

## Installation

Simply clone or download this repo, then go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and enable Developer Mode.
After that you should be able to add it as an unpacked extension.

## Known Issues

It's fairly brittle, any major changes to HN would result in this breaking, but I doubt that happens anytime soon.
